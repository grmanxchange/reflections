When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Using a remote repository certainly comes in handy when either multiple people are working on the same project, or when one changes ones computer/laptop frequently. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It may be the case that I do not want to incorporate all the changes from the online repository into my local files. For example, I may make changes to my local repository that would be incompatible with the online one, just to try out a few things. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of the other?
Forks refer to "copies" of someone else's repository directly onto my Github account. Clones, on the other hand, are also "copies" of repositories onto a local machine. Lastly, branches refer to different versions of the same file. If I would like to copy something directly onto Github, I would use a fork; if I would like to copy something locally, I would use a clone. If I want to work on the same project, yet introduce some changes, I would set up a new branch. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
In a sense, this will enable later merges with divergent states of the local and remote repository. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier and what would be harder?
Without Git or Github, I think I would collaborate using software like Dropbox or Google Drive. In that case, however, it would be very difficult to keep track of and merge different versions of the same file. It might, however, be easier to get everyone up to speed with the requirements of the software.

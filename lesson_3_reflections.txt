When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Using a remote repository certainly comes in handy when either multiple people are working on the same project, or when one changes ones computer/laptop frequently. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It may be the case that I do not want to incorporate all the changes from the online repository into my local files. For example, I may make changes to my local repository that would be incompatible with the online one, just to try out a few things.
